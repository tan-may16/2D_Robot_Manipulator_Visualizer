# 2D-Robot-Manipulator-Visualizer
OpenGL implementation of 2D Robot Manipulator Visualizer which can be used in Warehouses and Gantry Systems for Automation.

## Overview
As industry is shifting towards automation to reduce manual efforts, 2D Robot Manipulator Visualizer is a visualization of warehouse automation and gantry systems to display the ability and functionality of robots in industries. This implementation has been done in C++ OpenGL.

## System Requirements
Even though the project code is originally written to be system independent, some of the included/imported files  (eg: Fssimplewindow.h) are system dependent and need to be replaced with their versions compatible to those OS. The files currently included are Windows specific. Please let us know if you need to run the code on Linux/Mac systems.

## Installation and Implementation
**Step 1: Clone this repository.**
```shell
git clone https://github.com/tan-may16/2D_Robot_Manipulator_Visualizer.git
```

**Step2: Run extension file to visualize and test results.**
```shell
cd 2D-Robot-Manipulator-Visualizer/Code
Robotic_Arm_Manipulator.exe
```
